EBOX plans 

(in future we will integrate a senor that check that the box door is open or closed (so it will show the box door status so that full security get to out parcle ) so after we open these box form the app and when the door closed again the sensor d techt that and lock the box automatically ) 


online and offline plan 


for now its fine now listen my next plan properly then make phase to implement ........so listen we have to also store the device online and off line status beacaue our device will work on two modes onlie and the offline mode ...talikng about the online mode when the device is connected with the wifi network succesfully . so when the deliveru boy comes he callus so we unlock the box form our app and then the delivery amn keep the parcle and then the box will close and then we lock the box again . (and the camera click the image and send to the user app for now we are not focusing on camera  ) .... so this is the online working model ...but what if the wifi or internet not works ...so for that i had decided that we will fit 500  6 digit randamize otp in the box and the the same randomise otp in the app also i the same order so as soon as our box goes offline the this phase will start (one more thing when the box is on line the keypad will diconnectd means no keypad entried will regiester as the device goes to offline mode then the keypad will activate ) so when the delivery boy comes so our app show s that the box is offline so we say the delivery box to enter a initializer code like *123* (this is an initializer code so that if someone is randomly tyoing any numbers on the device the device should not respond ) till now the oled will be off when the enitiliser code enter then the display shows enter the ofline otp so one user app we add a feature of the off line otp so he generate and offline otp and told to delivery man .then the delivery man enter that code the box opens ans show on the display then the delivery man keep the parcle inside and after 30 sec the box will automatically lock .  and the again the camera click the image of inside of the box and then store locallly and then when device get online he will sent to user app . so now your work is to under all these and tell me phase wise work  i have to done .
